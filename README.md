# Developing an operator with operator-sdk

This example operator (`DummyOperator`) allows creating CR of type `Dummy`. The controller of the operator creates a `deployment` and a `service` based on the `Dummy` object.

## Prerequisites

- git
- go version 1.18
- Ensure that your GOPROXY is set to "https://proxy.golang.org|direct"

## Install operator-sdk

Installing through git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk
cd operator-sdk
git checkout master
make install
```

You must have a k8s cluster available with kubeconfig configured.
Check for OLM (Operator Lifecycle management) (https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/olm-integration/tutorial-bundle/#enabling-olm):
```bash
operator-sdk olm status
operator-sdk olm install
```
Initialize the empty github repository for the operator and copy its URL.
Create the operator folder and initialize the operator (the `--plugins=go/v4-alpha` is to develop with Mac Silicon only):
```bash
mkdir dummy-operator
cd dummy-operator
operator-sdk init --plugins=go/v4 --domain alessandroargentieri.com --repo github.com/alessandroargentieri/dummy-operator
```

Initialize the API:
```bash
operator-sdk create api --group apps --version v1 --kind Dummy --resource --controller
make manifests
```

Shape the Custom Resource with all the necessary fields by modifying the `api/v1/dummy_types.go` with `spec` and `status`
Update the CR definition with:
```bash
make manifest
```
Shape the controller logic (`controllers/dummy_controller.go`)
Modify the YAML given as sample (`config/samples/apps_v1_dummy.yaml`)

## Running the controller outside the cluster

You can debug and run the controller outside the cluster thanks to the configured kubeconfig you have in your terminal:
```bash
# apply the CR definition to the cluster
$ kubectl apply -f config/crd/bases/
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/dummies.apps.alessandroargentieri.com created

# run the controller outside the cluster
$ go run main.go
```

Deploy an example of CR:
```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/apps_v1_dummy.yaml
```

## Run the operator inside the cluster

To run the operator inside the cluste you need to adjust the permission on top of the reconcile method of the controller (`controllers/dummy_controller.go`)

```golang
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=apps.alessandroargentieri.com,resources=dummies,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=apps.alessandroargentieri.com,resources=dummies/status,verbs=get;update;patch
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=apps.alessandroargentieri.com,resources=dummies/finalizers,verbs=update
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=apps,resources=deployments,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=apps,resources=daemonsets,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=core,resources=services,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=core,resources=pods,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups="",resources=secrets,verbs=get;list;watch
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=rbac.authorization.k8s.io,resources=roles;rolebindings,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete
func (r *DummyReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {...}
```

Update the manifests:
```bash
make manifests
```

Login your terminal to the Docker repository account and build and publish the docker image:
N.B.:
To let it work for k3s amd processors from a Mac Silicon I needed to update the Dockerfile in this part:
```Dockerfile
# RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=${TARGETOS:-linux} GOARCH=${TARGETARCH} go build -a -o manager main.go
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 GO111MODULE=on go build -a -o manager main.go
```
Run the build and push:
```bash
make docker-build IMG=alessandroargentieri/dummy-operator:v0.0.1
make docker-push IMG=alessandroargentieri/dummy-operator:v0.0.1
```

I've created a `dist` folder copying/pasting the files from `config/rbac` and `config/crd/bases/apps.alessandroargentieri.com_dummies.yaml`.

I've changed some portions of the YAMLs and added a `controller.yaml` to allow deploying the controller inside the cluster through its docker image and a k8s deployment object.
I've preponed the number from 1 to 6 to the yaml file names to let them be applied in order.

Then, simply apply:
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f dist
namespace/operators unchanged
serviceaccount/dummy-operator-svc unchanged
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/manager-role configured
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/manager-rolebinding unchanged
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/dummies.apps.alessandroargentieri.com unchanged
deployment.apps/dummy-operator-controller-deployment created
```
Deploy an example of CR:
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: apps.alessandroargentieri.com/v1
kind: Dummy
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: dummy-sample
  name: dummy-sample
spec:
  dummyDeployment:
    image: nginx
    replicas: 3
  dummyService:
    type: NodePort
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 31500
EOF
dummy.apps.alessandroargentieri.com/dummy-sample created
```
Check for the operator logs:
```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n operators
NAME                                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dummy-operator-controller-deployment-6cd77658b6-rgbbx   1/1     Running   0          39h

$ kubectl logs dummy-operator-controller-deployment-6cd77658b6-rgbbx -n operators
```

Port forward to nginx service to verify that service and deployment have been correctly created by the operator:

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward services/dummy-sample-3-service 8085:80
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8085 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8085 -> 80
Handling connection for 8085
```

From another terminal perform the call to the service and check if the ngix deployment responds:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8085

# Operator-sdk autogenerated readme portion

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/dummy-operator:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/dummy-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```
### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
